This repository cointains the code of the project for DataWarehouses course (HSE, Moscow, Business-Informatics 3d grade).

In this project we are supposed to get data of airplane flights in JFK airport, NYC, US and the weather in it during 4 months in 2021.
Then, we gotta download them to the src lvl, create etl procedures for transferring the data to the staging lvl, detailed data storage lvl and data marts lvl.
So far, everything up to staging is covered. 

Next steps:
  - complete etl1: src -> staging code (turn it to PROC)
  - design etl2: staging -> dds
  - write the code (etl2)
  - design data marts
  - design etl for tranfer etl3: dds -> marts
  - ...
